# Save Your Autosave

You can find it in the 3D viewport's "View" tab.

!["Acitve Modal Operators"](doc_ui.png)

It displays the last time autosave occurred for the current session. This will help to see that active modal operators delay autosave.

It will also display a history of modal operators, with the following 3 buttons:

- open the modal operator's file in Blender text editor
- open folder containing the file
- remove operator from list (this does *not* cancel the modal operator or unregister it. It just removes it from the history)
